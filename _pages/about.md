Thanks
------
Thanks to most of the teachers in my International Elite Special Education Plan, who always provided insightful knowledge and ideas for diverse experiments. These inspirations give me the energy to spend time on meaningful projects and research. 

Mostly, I need to thank my director--Professor [Yongbin Yu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37879579100), who helped me with my research projects. 

Lastly, I appreciate the coworkers (postgraduate and Doctoral students) in my laboratory who support me in many ways, and they are so lovely :smile: , always providing me with good ideas.
