Here is my Profile
======
I'm Zhexian Zhou, or you can call me Jako, an undergraduate student in Software Engineering (Elite Class) at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). During my semesters in college and my academic journey, I have actively engaged in various groups and contributed to numerous projects. Notably, I and a member of the UESTC Digital Information System Research Laboratory under the guidance of Professor [Yongbin Yu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37879579100). A collection of projects is open-source under my [Github: JakoError Account](https://github.com/JakoError). Please feel free to explore them if interested. I specialize in the investigation, exploration, and implementation of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision technologies.
